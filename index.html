        <p class="sub-title2">Foreword: The following visualization is dedicated to my late father who was a college basketball player and a big influence for my love of the game. Naturally, NBA was introduced to me and I fell deeper in love with the game. <br>Tied with my passion to the game, I would love to discover interesting data and information about the game with the viewers reading this. Enjoy.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 300%;">Demographics in NBA</span><br><br>
        Of course most NBA players would come from United States of America. However, as the game of NBA basketball progresses, so do the international players. 
        <br><br>
        For instance, <span class="test">France</span> has a total of <span class="test">35 NBA players</span> (Most NBA players in a country next to Canada and USA) and two of the generational talents include <span class="test">Tony Parker (Retired) and Rudy Gobert</span>. One was a four-time NBA Champion
        and another was Three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.
        <br><br>
        Despite <span class="test">Greece</span> having only <span class="test">9 NBA players</span>, one of the most inspiring Greek-Nigerian professional basketball player certainly made his mark by leading the Bucks to their first NBA championship since 1971. His name is <span class="test">Giannis Antetokounmpo</span> and he proved that Greece is one country to watch out for.

    <section><span style="font-size: 300%;">The Size Factor <br> <span style="color: rgb(198, 198, 199);">(Are you fit to be in the NBA)</span></span><br><br>"...You should get into sports like basketball with that height of yours" is a common quote some people hear every now and then. That is a reasonable statement in fact, professional basketball players must be tall to be competitive in the league. <span class="test">In the visualisation of the weights and heights of professional basketball players in 1996 to 2022 below</span>, the <span class="test">average height</span> of a basketball player is <span class="test">between 195cm to 210cm</span>. The <span class="test">tallest basketball player</span> was <span class="test">Elhadji Tacko Sereigne Diop Fall</span>, a <span class="test">229cm</span> tall Senegalese. While the <span class="test">shortest player</span> is <span class="test">Muggsy Bogues</span>, with a height of <span class="test">160cm</span>. Another interesting fact that can be seen from the visualization is that the <span class="test">average weight of NBA players</span> is between <span class="test">90kg to 110kg</span>.</section>

        <span style="font-size: 300%;">Lebron, Kobe, or Jordan</span><br><br>
        Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Lebron James were and still are the undeniably most influential NBA players. 
        <br><br>
Although <span class="test">Lebron James</span> has the <span class="test">least won championships</span> (i.e. <span class="test">4 championships won compare to 5 and 6 championships won by Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan respectively</span>), statistically, Lebron James is unsurpassed in terms of personal scoring stats. (e.g. <span class="test">Average points per game is 27.1 compare to 24.2 and 25.3</span>)
